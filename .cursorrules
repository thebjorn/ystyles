# PROJECT OVERVIEW

I want to create a css framework for my company.
The framework should be a collection of css classes that can be used to style the company's website.
The framework should be written in scss and should be a collection of scss partials.
It should be possible to install the framework via npm and use it in a project by importing the scss partials.
It should be possible to use the framework in a svelte project by importing the scss partials.
It should be possible to create custom themes by overriding the default variables.
Dark mode and light mode should be supported for every theme.
The library should expose design tokens for colors, fonts, spacing, etc.
There should be a documentation site that explains how to use the framework.
The documentation should be written in mdsvex and should be part of the same project as the framework.
The documentation should be part of the same project as the framework.
It should be possible to switch between light and dark mode by using the system's preferred color scheme.
It should be possible to switch between themes by using a dropdown in the top right corner of the page.
